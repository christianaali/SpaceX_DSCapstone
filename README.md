# SpaceX_DSCapstone
This repository is part of the Coursera course: IBM Applied Data Science Capstone. 

In this course, I was given the opportunity to explore a SpaceX API and learn about everything Falcon 9.
From data collection to web scraping, EDA to ML predictive models, I have learned a lot, and am excited to carry this knowledge forward in my future career.

### About Me
A little bit about me, I am a Florida Tech student pursuing a Bachelors in Applied Mathematics. Funnily enough, because all of my friends are Aerospace Engineering majors, people think I am too. It absolutely does not help that I have a fascination for astronomy and astrophysics in general.

### Closing Thoughts?
This definitely is not the best project ever as it is a learning experience, but I absolutely will be finding other topics and datasets to psychoanalyse mathematically haha.


#### Thanks for reading,
KIMBERLY A.
